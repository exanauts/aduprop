TASKS

- Creation of system should be outside the if/else so I can do the same operations afterwards.
- Flag to specify initial conditions from outside file (so I can do the Monte Carlo from python and don't spend years trying to sample from a gaussian in C++).
- Trajectory file shoukld be able to have a different name from command line (again , for monte carlo).
